Conventional alarm systems provide few alarm customization options and use jarring noises that may startle small children. These systems can be reconfigured by children, whether accidentally or intentionally, which results in unintended behavior. Parents and guardians have little control over options such as alarm type, customization, and sleep scheduling.

WakeyWakey is a child-focused, guardian-managed alarm clock app for iOS and Android. Guardians create weekly schedules, each with a set of daily alarms. Each alarm has a timing for a child to go to bed, wake up, and get out of bed. Alarms are highly customizable, with child-friendly avatars and sounds, color changes, and configurable snooze functionality. Settings are protected by a passcode to avoid unintentional changes.

WakeyWakey provides guardians the means of enforcing a more rigid – yet gentle and friendly – weekly sleep schedule for their children.
